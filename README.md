# News-App
Created a News App from scratch using HTML5|CSS3|JavaScript.
Used news *API* for fetching live data for the news app.
In this app the user can come and read all the news thats going around the world.
We have created "news cards" and the user can click on any news card if he/she wishes to read the entire article.
The user gets re-directed on the original article in a new tab.
"Filteration functionality" is also provided wherein the user can choose the country and category and will be able to see the news related to that country and category.
